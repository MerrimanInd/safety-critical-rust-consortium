        ## Submit a Tool to the Consortium
        If you maintain, sell, or use a software tool that would be useful to the safety-critical Rust community we want to hear about it. This might include statis analysis, hardware deployment, compilers, or libraries/crates.

        The consortium may publicize this tool on email publications, websites ([Are We Safety Critical Yet](www.arewesafetycriticalyet.com)), or at meetings. However, we may also deem the tool as not safety-critical, not mature enough (yet), or unmaintained and decline to publish it.
